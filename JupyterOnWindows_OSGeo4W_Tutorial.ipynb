    "# Running GRASS in Jupyter Notebooks in Windows with OSGeo4W\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the Python package `grass.jupyter`, has streamlined the use of GRASS GIS is Jupyter notebooks. In this tutorial we will demonstrate the recommended way of running GRASS GIS in Jupyter Notebooks for Windows users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, we'll use the OSGeo4W package manager to setup and update GRASS GIS, Jupyterlab and other dependencies. Follow the directions below to setup Jupyter and GRASS in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *1. Download the OSGeo4W Network Installer*\n",
    "> Download the OSGeo4W network install from [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). Open it and select _\"Advanced Install\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *2. Install GRASS GIS, Jupyterlab and `grass.jupyter` dependencies*\n",
    "> Follow the prompts until you get to the _\"Select Packages\"_ window (the defaults are fine for most situations). Use the Search bar to find and select the following packages for install (switching from \"Skip\" to the version number):\n",
    "> * `grass`\n",
    "> * `python3-jupyterlab`\n",
    "> * `python3-ipywidgets`\n",

    "##### *3. Go make a cup of tea*\n",
    "> It may take a minute to install... Click \"Finish\" and exit when it finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *3. Open the OSGeo4W Shell and install folium*\n",
    "> Launch the OSGeo4W Shell and install folium with:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `pip install folium`\n",
    "\n",

    ">\n",
    ">`jupyter lab`\n",
    ">\n",
    ">This should launch Jupyter lab in your default web browser. Use the left side panel to navigate to the notebook you wish to run and you're ready to go!\n",
