In previous tutorials we have gone through some of the basics of using 
GRASS GIS through/with R and Python. As you might recall then, there's
an R package called [rgrass](https://github.com/rsbivand/rgrass/) that provides 
basic functionality to read and write data from and into GRASS database as well 
as to execute GRASS tools in either existing or temporary GRASS projects. 
The [GRASS Python API](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/index.html) 
on the other hand is composed of various packages that provide classes and 
functions for low and high level tasks, including those that can be executed with rgrass.
<!-- In a previous tutorial we explored the basic functionality of  -->
<!-- [grass.script](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/script.html)  -->
<!-- and [grass.jupyter](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/grass.jupyter.html),  -->
<!-- but there are other Python packages like  -->
<!-- [pygrass](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/pygrass_index.html),  -->
<!-- [temporal](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/temporal_framework.html),  -->
<!-- [gunittest](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/gunittest_testing.html), -->
<!-- that will be addressed in upcoming tutorials. -->

As you might have noticed there are some parallelisms between the **rgrass** and 
**grass.script**/**grass.jupyter** packages, i.e., R and Python interfaces to 
GRASS GIS. In this short tutorial we will go through these similarities in order
to highlight the equivalencies and streamline the use of GRASS extensive 
functionality within R and Python communities. 

Let's quickly review the equivalencies and go through some examples.

## Examples

Let's see how usage examples would look like. 

1. **Load the library**: Either if we are working in R or in Python, we need to 
load the libraries that will, in this case, allow us to interface with GRASS GIS 
functionality and (optionally) data. For the Python case, we first need to add 
the GRASS python package path to our system's path.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
library(rgrass)
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
import sys
import subprocess

sys.path.append(
    subprocess.check_output(["grass", "--config", "python_path"], text=True).strip()
)

import grass.script as gs
import grass.jupyter as gj
```

:::

2. **Start GRASS GIS session**: Once we loaded or imported the packages, we 
start a GRASS GIS session. In both cases we need to somehow pass the path to a 
temporary or existing GRASS project. 
In the case of R, we are also required to pass the path to GRASS GIS binaries, 
that in the Python case was needed for library import above. 
Here, it is worth noting that while grass.scrip and grass.jupyter init functions
take the same arguments, `gj.init` also sets other environmental variables to 
streamline work within Jupyter Notebooks, e.g., overwrite is set to true so cells
can be executed multiple times.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
session <- initGRASS(gisBase = "/usr/lib/grass83", # where grass binaries live, `grass --config path`
                     gisDbase = "/home/user/grassdata", # path to grass database or folder where your project lives
                     location = "nc_basic_spm_grass7", # existing project name 
                     mapset = "PERMANENT" # mapset name
                     ) 
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
# with grass.script
gs.setup.init(path="/home/user/grassdata",
              location="nc_basic_spm_grass7",
              mapset="PERMANENT")
# optionally, the path to a mapset
gs.setup.init("/home/user/grassdata/nc_basic_spm_grass7/PERMANENT")

# with grass.jupyter
session = gj.init(path="/home/user/grassdata",
                  location="nc_basic_spm_grass7",
                  mapset="PERMANENT")
# optionally, the path to a mapset
gj.init("/home/user/grassdata/nc_basic_spm_grass7/PERMANENT")
```

:::

3. **Execute GRASS commands**: Both interfaces work pretty similarly, the 
first argument is always the GRASS module name and then we pass the parameters
and flags. While in R we basically use `execGRASS()` for all GRASS commands, in 
the Python API, we have different wrappers to execute GRASS commands depending
on the nature of their output.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
# map output
execGRASS("r.slope.aspect", 
          elevation = "terra_elev", 
          slope = "slope",
          aspect = "aspect")

# text output
execGRASS("g.region",
          raster = "elevation",
          flags = "p")
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
# map output
gs.run_command("r.slope.aspect", 
               elevation = "terra_elev", 
               slope = "slope",
               aspect = "aspect")
# text output
gs.read_command("g.region",
                raster = "elevation",
                flags = "p")
# text output - dictionary
gs.parse_command("g.region",
                 raster = "elevation",
                 flags = "p")
```

:::

4. **Read raster and vector data into other R or Python formats**:
*rgrass* functions `read_RAST()` and `read_VECT()` convert GRASS raster and 
vector maps into terra's SpatRaster and SpatVector objects within R. 
In the case of Python, we only have such a functionality for GRASS 
raster maps that can be converted into numpy arrays through 
`gs.array.array()`. Vector attribute data however can be converted into 
pandas data frames using `StringIO` function within pandas `read_csv`.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
# raster
elevr <- read_RAST("elevation")

# vector
schoolsr <- read_VECT("schools")
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
# raster
import numpy as np
elev = gs.array.array("elevation")

# vector
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
schoolsp = gs.read_command("v.db.select", map="schools").strip()
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(schoolsp), sep="|")
```

:::


5. **Write R or Python objects into GRASS raster and vector maps**: R terra's 
SpatRaster and SpatVector objects can be written (back) into GRASS format with
`write_RAST()` and `write_VECT()` functions. Within the Python environment, 
numpy arrays can also be written (back) into GRASS raster maps with the 
`write()` method. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
# raster
write_RAST(elevr, "elevation_r")

# vector
write_VECT(schoolsr, "schools_r")
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
# raster
elev.write(mapname="elev_np", overwrite=True)
```

:::


6. **Close GRASS GIS session**: In general, just closing R or Rstudio, as well
as shutting down Jupyter notebook, will clean up and close the GRASS session 
properly. Sometimes, however, especially if the user changed mapset within the 
workflow, is better to clean up explicitly before closing.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

```{r}
unlink_.gislock()
```

## Python

```{python}
#| python.reticulate: FALSE
session.finish()
```

### Final remarks

The examples and comparisons presented here are intended to facilitate the
combination of tools and languages as well as the exchange of data and format
conversions. We hope that's useful as starting point for the implementation
of different use cases and workflows that suit the needs of different users.
