In this third part of the time series tutorials, we will go through different 
temporal algebra examples. There are five modules within the temporal framework
that allow us to perform temporal map algebra on different types of data: 
[t.rast.mapcalc](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast.mapcalc.html), 
[t.rast.algebra](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast.algebra.html), 
[t.rast3d.mapcalc](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast3d.mapcalc.html),
[t.rast3d.algebra](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast3d.algebra.html), and 
[t.vect.algebra](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.vect.algebra.html). 
We will focus on the raster oriented tools in this tutorial. 

::: {.callout-note title="Setup"}
This tutorial can be run locally or in Google Colab. However, make sure you
install GRASS GIS 8.3+, download the LST sample data and set up your project
as explained in the [first part](time_series_management_and_visualization.qmd) 
of these time series tutorials.

## [t.rast.mapcalc](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast.mapcalc.html) vs [t.rast.algebra](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast.algebra.html)

Both tools allow us to perform spatio-temporal operations on temporally sampled
maps of raster time series (STRDS). Also, both tools support spatial and 
temporal functions. 
Spatial operators and functions are those used in 
[r.mapcalc](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.mapcalc.html). 
Temporal internal variables supported for both relative and absolute time 
include: `td()` (time delta), `start_time()` and `end_time()`. 
There are also several useful internal temporal variables supported especially 
for absolute time, e.g.: `start_doy()`, `start_year()`, `start_month()` and
so on.

Both *t.rast.mapcalc* and *t.rast.algebra* support temporal operations. However, 
only *t.rast.algebra* is effectively temporally aware; *t.rast.mapcalc* 
is mostly a wrapper around *r.mapcalc*. Indeed, t.rast.algebra is able to 
perform a wide range of temporal operations based on the temporal topology 
of maps within STRDS. Supported operators, relations and functions in
t.rast.algebra include:

- Temporal operators: union (`u`), intersection (`i`), left reference (`l`), etc.
- Temporal relations: `equals`, `during`, `contains`, `starts`, etc.
- Temporal selection: `:` and `!:`.
- Temporal functions: `td()`, `start_time()`, `start_doy()`, `#`, `tmap()`, `map()`, `t_snap()`, `buff_t()`, `t_shift()`, etc.
- Temporal neighborhood modifier: `[x,y,t]`.
- Spatial operators: `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`,`%`.
- Spatial functions: `abs(x)`, `float(x)`, `int(x)`, `log(x)`, `round(x)`, `isnull(x)`,`null()`, among others.

They can all be combined in nested expressions with conditions statements 
to create spatio-temporal operators! In general, expressions have the following 
structure:
`{"spatial or select operator", "temporal relations", "temporal operator"}` 
and they can be combined with conditional statements such as:
`if(topologies, conditions, A, B)` where A and B can be either space time 
datasets or expressions (e.g., A+B). Just for illustration purposes, let's see
some examples from the manual page:

- `C = A {+,equal,l} B`: C will have the same time stamps than A and will be A+B for all maps with equal time stamps among A and B, this is equivalent to `C = A + B`, i.e., *equal* is the default temporal relation for algebra operations and *left reference* is the default temporal operator. 
- `C = if(start_date(A) < "2005-01-01", A + B)`: C will be A+B if the start date of A is earlier than Jan 1st, 2005 (if, then statement).
- `C = if({equal}, A > 100 && A < 1600 {&&,equal} td(A) > 30, B)`: C will have all cells from  B with equal temporal relations to A, if the cells of A are in the range (100.0, 1600) of time intervals that have more than 30 time units. This is equivalent to `C = if(A > 100 && A < 1600 && td(A) > 30, B)`.
- `C = A {:, during} tmap(event)`: C will contain all maps from A that are during the temporal extent of the single map 'event'.
- `C = A * map(constant_value)`: C will contain all raster maps from A multiplied by the raster map 'constant_value' (a map without time stamp).
- `B = if(A > 0.0 && A[-1] > 0.0 && A[-2] > 0.0, start_doy(A, 0), 0)`: B will have the DOY for all maps from A where conditions are met at three consecutive time intervals, otherwise put 0.


Let's see some examples using the LST daily time series from northern Italy. We
start with something simple to also refresh what we learnt in the previous
tutorial about aggregations.

<!-- 
t.rast.mapcalc input=tempmean_monthly output=january_under_0 basename=january_under_0 \
expression="if(start_month() == 1 && tempmean_monthly > 0, null(), tempmean_monthly)" 
-->

### Anomalies

To estimate annual anomalies, we need the long term average and standard 
deviation of the whole series, and the annual averages. Then, we estimate
the standardized anomalies as:

$$
StdAnom_i = \frac{Avg_i - Avg}{SD}
$$

Let's first obtain the average and standard deviation for the series:

```{python}
# Get general average and SD
methods=["average","stddev"]

for me in methods:
    gs.run_command("t.rast.series",
                   input="lst_daily",
                   method=me,
                   output=f"lst_{me}")
```

and then the annual LST average:

```{python}
# Get annual averages
gs.run_command("t.rast.aggregate",
               input="lst_daily",
               method="average",
               granularity="1 years",
               output="lst_annual_average",
               basename="lst_average",
               suffix="gran",
               nprocs=6)
```

We now use t.rast.algebra to estimate the anomalies.

```{python}
# Estimate annual anomalies
expression="lst_annual_anomaly = (lst_annual_average - map(lst_average)) / map(lst_stddev)"

gs.run_command("t.rast.algebra",
               expression=expression,
               basename="lst_annual_anomaly",
               suffix="gran",
               nprocs=6)
```

We set the *differences* color palette and then create an animation. 

```{python}
# Set difference color table
gs.run_command("t.rast.colors",
               input="lst_annual_anomaly",
               color="difference")
```

```{python}
# Animation of annual anomalies
anomalies = gj.TimeSeriesMap(use_region=True)
anomalies.add_raster_series("lst_annual_anomaly", fill_gaps=False)
anomalies.d_legend(color="black", at=(10,40,2,6))
anomalies.show()
```


### Month with maximum LST

We will use `t.rast.mapcalc` to obtain the month when the maximum LST occurred
during our study period. We already estimated the map with the maximum LST
in the previous tutorial, but let's refresh our memories:

```{python}
gs.run_command("t.rast.series",
               input="lst_daily",
               output=f"lst_maximum",
               method="maximum",
               nprocs=4)
```

Then, we use t.rast.mapcalc to compare all maps in lst_daily with the lst_maximum
map and save the month only when there's a match. The result will probably be a
very sparse time series.

```{python}
# Get time series with month of maximum LST
expression="if(lst_daily == lst_maximum, start_month(), null())"

gs.run_command("t.rast.mapcalc",
               flags="n", # register also null maps
               inputs="lst_daily",
               output="month_max_lst",
               basename="month_max_lst",
               expression=expression,
               nprocs=6)
```

```{python}
# Get basic info
print(gs.read_command("t.info", 
                      input="month_min_lst"))
```

Now we can aggregate our sparse time series to obtain the earliest month in 
which the maximum LST occurred.

```{python}
# Get the earliest month in which the maximum appeared (method=minimum)
gs.run_command("t.rast.series",
               input="month_max_lst",
               method="minimum",
               output="max_lst_date")
```

Remover la STRDS intermedia y los mapas que contiene:

```{python}
# Remove month_max_lst strds; we were only interested in the resulting aggregated map
gs.run_command("t.remove",
               flags="rfd", # recursive, force, delete
               inputs="month_max_lst")
               
# Check it's gone
print(gs.read_command("t.list"))
```

Let's display the result using the `Map` class from `grass.jupyter` package:

```{python}
mm = gj.Map(width=450, use_region=True)
mm.d_rast(map="max_lst_date")
mm.d_vect(map="italy", type="boundary", color="#4D4D4D", width=2)
mm.d_legend(raster="max_lst_date", title="Month", fontsize=10, at=(2,15,2,10))
mm.d_barscale(length=50, units="kilometers", segment=4, fontsize=14, at=(73,7))
mm.d_northarrow(at=(90,15))
mm.d_text(text="Month of maximum LST", color="black", font="sans", size=4, bgcolor="white")
mm.show()
```

::: {.callout-note}
How could we have done the same in one single step? 
Hint: `t.rast.algebra ... method=during`.

```{python}
# Get time series with month of maximum LST
expression="month_max_lst = if({during}, lst_daily == tmap(lst_maximum), start_month(), null())"

gs.run_command("t.rast.algebra",
               basename="month_max_lst",
               expression=expression,
               suffix="gran",
               nprocs=6)
```

Is it really the same?

```{python}
expression="result = max_lst_date - month_max_lst"
gs.rast_mapcalc(exp=expression)
gs.raster_info("result")
```

:::{.callout-caution}
What if we are interested in knowing the week number in which the annual maximum 
LST occurs each year? How would you do that? Can we also know if there's any 
trend in the week number? i.e., does it tend to happen earlier or later?

```{python}
# Estimate annual max LST
!t.rast.aggregate input=lst_daily output=lst_max_annual basename=lst_max method=maximum granularity="1 years" suffix=gran

# Week number
!t.rast.algebra expression="week_lst_max_annual = if({contains}, lst_max_annual == lst_daily, start_week(lst_daily))" basename=week_lst_max_annual suffix=gran 

# Is there a trend?
!t.rast.series input=week_lst_max_annual method=slope output=slope_week_lst_max_annual
```

### Number of days with LST >= 20 and <= 30

Some plague insects tend to thrive in a certain range of temperatures. Let's 
assume this range is from 20 to 30 °C. Here, we'll estimate the number of days 
within this range per year, and then, we'll estimate the median along years.

```{python}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# Keep only pixels meeting the condition
expression="lst_higher20_lower30 = if(lst_daily >= 20.0 && lst_daily <= 30.0, 1, null())"

gs.run_command("t.rast.algebra",
               expression=expression, 
               basename="lst_higher20_lower30",
               suffix="gran",
               nproc=6, 
               flags="n")
```

```{python}
# Count how many times per year the condition is met
gs.run_command("t.rast.aggregate",
               input="lst_higher20_lower30", 
               output="count_lst_higher20_lower30",
               basename="count_lst_higher20_lower30",
               suffix="gran",
               method="count",
               granularity="1 years")
```

```{python}
# Check raster maps in the STRDS
gs.run_command("t.rast.list", 
               input="count_lst_higher20_lower30", 
               columns="name,start_time,min,max")
```

```{python}
# Median number of days with average lst >= 20 and <= 30
gs.run_command("t.rast.series",
               input="count_tmean_higher20_lower30",
               output="median_count_tmean_higher20_lower30",
               method="median")
```

```{python}
# Display raster map with interactive class
h20_map = gj.InteractiveMap(width = 500, use_region=True)
h20_map.add_raster("median_count_tmean_higher20_lower30")
h20_map.add_layer_control(position = "bottomright")
h20_map.show()
```

::: {.callout-note}
How would you check if the median number of days with lst >= 20 and <= 30 
is changing along the years?
:::

### Number of consecutive days with LST <= -10.0

Likewise, there are temperature thresholds that mark a limit to insects survival.
Here, we'll use the lower temperature threshold to survival. Most importantly, 
we we'll count the number of consecutive days with temperatures below this 
threshold.

Here, we'll use again the temporal algebra and we'll recall the concept of 
topology that we defined at the beginning of these tutorials. First, we need to 
create a STRDS of annual granularity that will contain only zeroes. This annual 
STRDS, that we call `annual_mask`, will be the base to add the value 1 each time
the condition of less than -10 °C in consecutive days is met. Finally, we 
estimate the median number of days with LST lower than -10 °C over the 5 years.

```{python}
# Create annual mask
gs.run_command("t.rast.aggregate",
               input="lst_daily",
               output="annual_mask",
               basename="annual_mask",
               suffix="gran",
               granularity="1 year",
               method="count")
```

```{python}
# Replace values by zero
expression="if(annual_mask, 0)"

gs.run_command("t.rast.mapcalc",
               input="annual_mask",
               output="annual_mask_0",
               expression=expression,
               basename="annual_mask_0")
```

```{python}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: hide

# Calculate consecutive days with LST <= -10.0
expression="lower_m10_consec_days = annual_mask_0 {+,contains,l} if(lst_daily <= -10.0 && lst_daily[-1] <= -10.0 || lst_daily[1] <= -10.0 && lst_daily <= -10.0, 1, 0)"

gs.run_command("t.rast.algebra",
               expression=expression,
               basename="lower_m10",
               suffix="gran",
               nproc=7)
```

```{python}
# Inspect values
gs.run_command("t.rast.list",
               input="lower_m10_consec_days",
               columns="name,start_time,min,max")
```

```{python}
# Median number of consecutive days with LST <= -10
gs.run_command("t.rast.series",
               input="lower_m10_consec_days",
               output="median_lower_m10_consec_days",
               method="median")
```

```{python}
# Display raster map with interactive class
lt10_map = gj.InteractiveMap(width = 500, use_region=True)
lt10_map.add_raster("median_lower_m10_consec_days")
lt10_map.add_layer_control(position = "bottomright")
lt10_map.show()
```
