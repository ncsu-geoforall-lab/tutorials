In this sixth part of the time series tutorials, we will go through time series
querying and compare and contrast the different tools available according to 
their inputs, outputs and other options. 
We will split tools into two groups according to their name to facilitate 
comparisons:

- temporal tools: [t.rast.what](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.rast.what.html), [t.rast.what.aggr](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/t.rast.what.aggr.html),[t.vect.observe.strds](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.vect.observe.strds.html), [t.vect.what.strds](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/t.vect.what.strds.html) and, 
- vector tools: [v.what.strds](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.what.strds.html), [v.what.strds.timestamp](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/v.what.strds.timestamp.html), [v.strds.stats](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/v.strds.stats.html).

::: {.callout-note title="Setup"}
This tutorial can be run locally or in Google Colab. However, make sure you
install GRASS GIS 8.4+, download the 
[LST sample project]() 
and set up your project as explained in the 
[first part](time_series_management_and_visualization.qmd) of these time
series tutorials.

```{python}
#| echo: false

import os
import sys
import subprocess

# GRASS GIS database variables
grassbin = "grass-dev"
grassdata = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), "grassdata")
project = "eu_laea"
mapset = "italy_LST_daily"

sys.path.append(
    subprocess.check_output([grassbin, "--config", "python_path"], text=True).strip()
)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false

# Import the GRASS GIS packages we need
import grass.script as gs
import grass.jupyter as gj

# Start the GRASS GIS Session
session = gj.init(grassdata, project, mapset);
```


## Temporal tools

All the temporal tools that allow to query raster time series take either 
coordinates or a point vector map as inputs to sample one or various STRDS. 
Regarding outputs, the *t.rast.\** tools retrieve values to stdout, write
them in plain text files or update the vector attribute table. In contrast, 
the *t.vect.\** tools output vector time series. Only two of these tools
allow to do queries with temporal aggregation of the raster data either 
according to a fixed date or a date column in the case of
*t.rast.what.aggr* or with temporal topology relations in the case of 
*t.vect.what.strds*.

Let's see some examples. We will first randomly extract the centroids of 15 
Italian regions in our study area and save them as a point vector map to
query the raster time series afterwards.

```{python}
# Extract 15 random centroids
gs.run_command("v.extract", 
               input="italy_borders_2_clip",
               type="centroid",
               output="regions_centroids",
               random=15)
               
# Convert centroids to points
gs.run_command("v.type", 
               input="regions_centroids", 
               output="sampling_points", 
               from_type="centroids", 
               to_type="points")
```

```{python}
# Display polygons and points
centroids = gj.Map(height = 500)
centroids.d_vect(map="italy_borders_2_clip")
centroids.d_vect(map="sampling_points")
centroids.show()
```

```{python}
# Calculate monthly LST time series
gs.run_command("t.rast.aggregate", 
               input="lst_daily", 
               output="lst_monthly",
               basename="lst_monthly",
               suffix="gran",
               method="average")
```

Let's start by using *t.rast.what* that will output the result in the standard
output, i.e., the terminal, the GUI console or the Jupyter cell.

```{python}
# Get LST monthly values for the points
gs.run_command("t.rast.what",
               points="sampling_points",
               strds="lst_monthly",
               layout="row",
               flags="n")
```

::: {.callout-note title="Layouts"}
Users can then play around with the different output layouts, i.e., 
*row, column, timerow*, to find the one that better suits their data
pipelines. 
:::

Now, to exemplify the use of *t.rast.what.aggr* imagine we did some mosquito
trappings in two different dates and we need to know which was the average
LST the two months before the trappings. Since the dates are different, we
actually need to aggregate different days. This is done on the fly (i.e., 
without the need to aggregate the whole raster time series) by the extension 
*t.rast.what.aggr*. Let's install it and add dates to our point vector map.


```{python}
# Install t.rast.what.aggr extension
gs.run_command("g.extension", extension="t.rast.what.aggr")
```

```{python}
# Add a new date type column
gs.run_command("v.db.addcolumn", 
               map="sampling_points",
               column="sampling_date date")
               
# Add values to the date column
gs.run_command("v.db.update", 
               map="sampling_points", 
               column="sampling_date",
               value="2018-08-27")
gs.run_command("v.db.update",
               map="sampling_points",
               column="sampling_date",
               value="2018-07-01",
               where="cat >= '68'")
```

We will use the daily time series in this case to get the aggregation 
period right.

```{python}
# Get aggregated LST values
gs.run_command("t.rast.what.aggr", 
               input="sampling_points", 
               strds="lst_daily", 
               date_column="sampling_date",
               granularity="2 months",
               method="average",
               flags="c")
```

Let's display the result by converting the attribute table into a Pandas 
DataFrame.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

data = gs.parse_command("v.db.select", 
                        map="sampling_points", 
                        format="json")
                        
pd.DataFrame(data['records'])
```

:::{.callout-note title="Question"}
What would be the result if we use the monthly time series?
:::

Let's demonstrate now the use of *t.vect.observe.strds* and 
*t.vect.what.strds*. These tools, as mentioned above, output a vector 
time series or stvds. Vector time series in GRASS GIS can be created either 
from a series of vector maps (especially if features/geometries vary in time) 
or from layers added to a single vector map (i.e., features are always the 
same, as in the case of meteorological stations).

We start with *t.vect.observe.strds*. It will create a new vector map with 
as many layers as raster maps there are in the strds we are querying and it 
will register these in a stvds.

```{python}
gs.run_command("t.vect.observe.strds",
               input="sampling_points",
               strds="lst_monthly",
               output="sp_lst_monthly",
               vector_output="sp_lst_monthly",
               columns="lst")
```

```{python}
# Check the stvds is created
gs.run_command("t.info",
               input="sp_lst_monthly",
               type="stvds")
```

```{python}
# Check number of layers in the vector map
gs.vector_info("sp_lst_monthly")
```

```{python}
# Check one layer
gs.vector_db_select("sp_lst_monthly", layer=7)["values"]
```

```{python}
# Check all layers
gs.run_command("t.vect.db.select",
               input="sp_lst_monthly")
```

Let's now compare the values obtained by querying the monthly LST time series
with those resulting from aggregating the daily LST time series. They should 
be the same. For that we need to specify the sampling relation. The temporal 
tool that allows to specify sampling relations and do temporal aggregation is
*t.vect.what.strds*. It requires a stvds as input, so we'll use the one we 
just obtained above. We also specify the *start* relation, so all maps in the 
strds which start time matches the stvds will be aggregated. Let's see this 
graphically before running the tool.

![](img/comparison_of_granularities.png)

```{python}
gs.run_command("t.vect.what.strds", 
               input="sp_lst_monthly", 
               strds="lst_daily", 
               column="lst_new", 
               method="average", 
               sampling="start")
```

```{python}
gs.run_command("t.vect.db.select",
               input="sp_lst_monthly")
```

As expected, results are exactly the same! So, if you are constrained by disk
space for example, you don't need to aggregate your entire strds if you only
need aggregated values for a set of points.


## Vector tools

The main difference between temporal and vector tools to query raster time
series is that vector tools can update the attribute table of the input vector
without creating more layers. Regarding inputs, both *v.what.strds* and 
*v.what.strds.timestamp* take a point vector map as input, while *v.strds.stats*
takes a line or polygon vector map and performs spatial aggregation, 
i.e. zonal stats over the full or a part of the strds. 
The extension *v.what.strds.timestamp*, somehow similar to *t.rast.what.aggr*,
offers the possibility of reading input points' date information from a column
in the attribute table and only performs the query for the dates that match. It
also offers spatial interpolation of the four nearest pixels.

| Tools/<br>options | [v.what.strds](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.what.strds.html) | [v.what.strds.timestamp](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/v.what.strds.timestamp.html) | [v.strds.stats](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/v.strds.stats.html) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Retrieves raster values from STRDSs using a point vector map | Matches points with timestamp in the attribute table with STRDSs based on point locations in space and time, and updates the input vector's attribute table | Calculates zonal statistics from STRDSs and uploads values to attribute columns of a new vector map |

| output | vector | vector | vector |
| where | yes | yes | yes |
| t_where | yes | yes | yes |
| spatial aggr |  |  | yes |
| temporal aggr |  |  |  |
| spatial interp | | yes | |

Let's go through the usage of the vector tools to query raster time series now.
When we run *v.what.strds* to query strds we can either save the results in 
a new vector map or update the input vector attribute table by setting the
`u` flag. In this case, we'll create a new vector map and do a temporal
selection.

```{python}
# Run v.what.strds with temporal selection
gs.run_command("v.what.strds",
               input="sampling_points",
               strds="lst_monthly",
               output="sp_lst_monthly_2014",
               t_where="start_time <= '2015-01-01'")
```

Let's check the new vector created. It contains a new column per map in the 
queried strds.

```{python}
data = gs.parse_command("v.db.select", 
                        map="sp_lst_monthly_2014", 
                        format="json")
                        
pd.DataFrame(data['records'])
```

The tool *v.what.strds.timestamp* is an extension so we need to install it first.
It will by default update the input vector attribute table with a column that 
needs to be specified by the user. Furthermore, it offers spatial interpolation 
of the four nearest cells via the `i` flag. Let's compare the results with and
without it.

```{python}
gs.run_command("g.extension", extension="v.what.strds.timestamp")
```

```{python}
# with spatial interp of neighbor cells
gs.run_command("v.what.strds.timestamp",
               input="sampling_points",
               timestamp_column="sampling_date",
               column="lst_sampling_date_i",
               strds="lst_daily",
               flags="i")
               
# without spatial interp of neighbor cells
gs.run_command("v.what.strds.timestamp",
               input="sampling_points",
               timestamp_column="sampling_date",
               column="lst_sampling_date_no_i",
               strds="lst_daily")
```

Let's check the results.

```{python}
data = gs.parse_command("v.db.select", 
                        map="sampling_points", 
                        format="json")
                        
pd.DataFrame(data['records'])
```

Finally, we'll extract zonal statistics of a raster time series. For this, we
need either a line or polygon vector map as input. We'll use the map of
italian municipalities and demonstrate the use of spatial (`where`) and temporal 
(`t_where`) selection.

```{python}
# Install v.strds.stats extension
gs.run_command("g.extension", extension="v.strds.stats")
```

```{python}
# Extract August average LST for Milano municipality
gs.run_command("v.strds.stats",
               input="italy_borders_3",
               strds="lst_monthly",
               where="NAME_3 == 'Milano'",
               t_where="strftime('%m', start_time)='08'",
               output="milano_lst_august",
               method="average")
```

```{python}
gs.vector_db_select("milano_lst_august")["values"]
```

Let's now try to find out which municipality in northern Italy had the highest 
August average temperature each year? 

```{python}
# Clip municipalities to computational region
gs.run_command("v.clip", 
               input="italy_borders_3", 
               output="italy_borders_3_clip", 
               flags="r")
```

```{python}
# Extract summer average LST municipalities
gs.run_command("v.strds.stats",
               input="italy_borders_3_clip",
               strds="lst_monthly",
               t_where="strftime('%m', start_time)='08'",
               output="municip_lst_august",
               method="average")
```

```{python}
# Check the output table
data = gs.parse_command("v.db.select", 
                        map="sampling_points", 
                        format="json")
                        
pd.DataFrame(data['records'])
```
