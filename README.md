# Tutorials
This repo is a temporary place holder for a set of jupyter and quarto notebooks to be used as tutorials within GRASS website and some maybe also included in docs within source code. 

### Visualizing Quarto notebooks

#### Download and install quarto

See <https://quarto.org/docs/download/> and follow the instructions for your system. 

#### Render the notebooks

There are different ways to render and preview Quarto notebooks. They can be rendered from **RStudio** by clicking the `Render` button as shown below:

They can also be rendered in **VS Code** from the `Preview` button if the Quarto extension is previously installed:

Finally, cloning this repo and running, eg.:
```
quarto preview grass_gis_in_google_colab.qmd
```
in a terminal will render the html output in the default internet browser.
