The [**rgrass**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass/index.html) 
package allow us to interact with GRASS GIS tools (and data) serving as an
interface between GRASS GIS and R.
The *rgrass* package is developed and maintained by Roger Bivand and can be 
found at: <https://github.com/rsbivand/rgrass/>. In this fast track tutorial, 
we will learn how to use GRASS GIS from R.

::: callout-note
**Setup note**:

To run this tutorial locally you should have GRASS GIS 8.4+, 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and, optionally, 
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed. 
You will also need to install *rgrass*, *terra* and *mapview*
R packages and download the 
[North Carolina sample dataset](https://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_basic_spm_grass7.zip).
:::

## *rgrass* main funtions

The main functions within **rgrass** are the following:

- `initGRASS()`: starts a GRASS GIS session from R.
- `execGRASS()`: executes GRASS GIS commands from R.
- `gmeta()`: prints GRASS GIS session metadata like database, project, mapset, computational region settings and CRS.
- `read_VECT()` and `read_RAST()`: read vector and raster maps from a GRASS project into R.
- `write_VECT()` and `write_RAST()`: write vector and raster objects from R into a GRASS GIS project.

## Basic Usage: Choose your own adventure

If you are a regular R user that needs to use GRASS GIS functionality 
**because, well, you know it rocks**, rgrass has your back. For example,
maybe you struggle with large raster datasets in R or you need some specific 
tool, like watershed delineation for a large high resolution DEM. We will show 
here the way to use GRASS GIS tools within your R workflows. 

On the other hand, if you already use GRASS as your geospatial data processing 
engine, you most likely have your spatial data within GRASS projects. 
You might need however to do some statistical analysis, some modelling and 
prediction or create publication ready visualizations in R. In such cases, 
you can start a GRASS GIS session in your project from R or RStudio.

Let's see the general **basic steps** and then dive into the details:

1.  Open R (or RStudio)
2.  Load `rgrass` library with `library(rgrass)`
3.  Start a GRASS GIS session with `initGRASS()`
4.  Use GRASS GIS modules through `execGRASS()`
5.  Use `read_VECT()`, `read_RAST()`, `write_VECT()` and `write_RAST()` to read data from and write data into GRASS database.


::: callout-note
GRASS raster and vector maps are translated into *terra*'s packege SpatRaster 
and SpatVector objects, respectively. These objects can then, within R, be 
easily coerced to other types of spatial objects such as simple features (sf), 
stars, etc.

See *terra* vignettes with further explanations and examples: 
<https://rspatial.github.io/terra/>.

### A. Use GRASS GIS tools within your R spatial workflows

In the case you need to include some of the cool GRASS GIS tools within your
R workflow, the `initGRASS()` function allows you to create temporary GRASS 
projects to use GRASS modules on R objects. 
This is equivalent to what QGIS does when you use GRASS tools via the 
Processing Toolbox.

So, the workflow goes like this: we will use `initGRASS()` to create a temporary 
GRASS project based on the extent, resolution and CRS of a raster or vector R object, 
likely the one we want to process or one that has the extent of our study area. 
Hence, we need to pass a reference spatial grid via the *SG* parameter. 
Then, we'll write our R objects into the temporary GRASS project, run the desired 
processes, export the outputs back to the R environment and done.

Let's start with getting some spatial data, eg. a raster file, into R.

```{r}
library(terra)
```

```{r}
f <- system.file("ex/elev.tif", package="terra")
r <- rast(f)
plot(r)
```

Now, we'll load the rgrass library and start GRASS GIS with `SG = r`, so a GRASS 
project is internally created with r's object CRS (BTW, you can check that with 
`crs(r)`), extent and resolution. These latter define the GRASS GIS computational
region that will affect all raster processing, i.e., all new raster maps generated
within GRASS GIS will have the same extent and resolution of the map provided. 
If you wish to change the computational region later on, you can use the 
`g.region` GRASS tool with `execGRASS("g.region --h")`.

```{r}
library(rgrass)
```

Note that we also pass `tempdir()` as the folder where our GRASS temporary project
will be created. `tempdir()` will default to whichever is the temporary folder 
in your operative system. 

```{r}
# path to GRASS binaries
grassbin <- system("grass --config path", intern = TRUE)

# start GRASS GIS from R
initGRASS(gisBase = grassbin, 
          home = tempdir(),
          SG = r, 
          override = TRUE)
```

Now, we can write our SpatRaster into the GRASS GIS temporary project.

```{r}
write_RAST(r, "terra_elev")
```

Alternatively, we can use GRASS GIS importing tools to import common raster and
vector formats. These will provide re-projection on the fly, if needed.

```{r}
execGRASS("r.import", input=f, output="test")
```

Let's check both are indeed within the project and run the GRASS module 
[`r.slope.aspect`](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.slope.aspect.html)
on it.

```{r}
execGRASS("g.list", type = "raster")
```

```{r}
execGRASS("r.slope.aspect", 
          elevation = "terra_elev", 
          slope = "slope",
          aspect = "aspect")
```

```{r}
execGRASS("g.list", type = "raster")
```

Let's get slope and aspect maps into R

```{r}
grass_maps <- read_RAST(c("aspect", "slope"))
grass_maps
```

Now that the output maps are back into our R environment, we can plot them, do
further analysis or write them into other raster formats, in which case we use
`terra::writeRaster()` function.

```{r}
plot(grass_maps)
```

```{r}
writeRaster(grass_maps, "grass_maps.tif", overwrite=TRUE)
```

Alternatively, we can use GRASS GIS exporting tools like 
[r.out.gdal](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.out.gdal.html) 
and [v.out.ogr](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.out.ogr.html), 
to directly save our outputs into common raster or vector files respectively.

```{r}
execGRASS("r.out.gdal", input="slope", output="slope.tif", format="GTiff", flags="overwrite")
```


### B. Use R tools within GRASS GIS workflows

Let's see an example for the case when we do all our geospatial data processing 
within GRASS and hence have all the spatial data organized within GRASS projects
but we need to run some statistical analysis, modelling, prediction 
or visualization in R.

We start R or Rstudio and load the `rgrass` library. It will tell us that GRASS 
is not running, but we know that already... and that's about to change in a 
moment.

```{r}
library(rgrass)
```

So, we start GRASS from within R or RStudio using the `initGRASS()` function. 
Since we want to start GRASS in a specific project and mapset, we need to specify 
them. Optionally, we specify which GRASS binary to use. This might be useful in 
the case we have many GRASS versions in our system. If not provided, `initGRASS()` 
will attempt to find it in default locations depending on your operative system.

```{r}
#| label: grass_init
#| message: false
#| panel: tabset

# path to GRASS binaries
grassbin <- system("grass --config path", intern = TRUE)
# path to GRASS database
grassdata <- path.expand("~/grassdata/")
# project name
project <- "nc_basic_spm_grass7"
# mapset name
mapset <- "PERMANENT"

# start GRASS GIS from R
initGRASS(gisBase = grassbin, 
          gisDbase = grassdata, 
          location = project, 
          mapset = mapset, 
          override = TRUE,
          remove_GISRC= TRUE)
```

We can now list and read our GRASS raster and vector maps into R and do our 
statistical analysis, modelling and/or visualizations using other R packages. 
Obviously, we can also use *rgrass* as a mere interface to analyze data within 
GRASS, i.e., no reading from or writing to GRASS GIS needed, we can just use 
GRASS from R. Here, we'll demonstrate the use of all the main *rgrass* functions 
mentioned above.

Let's then list our GRASS raster and vector maps:

```{r}
# list GRASS raster maps
execGRASS("g.list", parameters = list(type="raster"))
```

```{r}
# list GRASS vector maps
execGRASS("g.list", parameters = list(type="vector"))
```

The resulting map lists could be saved in an R object that we can subset later 
in case we want to import several but not all raster maps, for example. Let's 
see how to do that.

```{r}
# save map list in an object
rast_list <- execGRASS("g.list", parameters = list(type="raster"))
rast_list
```

```{r}
# retrieve only the maps list and overwrite rast_list
rast_list <- attributes(rast_list)$resOut

# import elevation and landuse
to_import <- c("elevation", "landuse") # optionally, by position: rast_list[c(3,7)]

maplist <- list()
for (i in to_import) {
  maplist[i] <- read_RAST(i)
}

maplist
```

Remember that raster objects will always be exported from GRASS GIS following the 
*computational region settings*. So, bear that in mind when reading into R which 
will hold them in memory. Vectors however will be exported in their full extent.

Let's load the *terra* library to quickly display our recently imported raster 
maps:

```{r}
library(terra)
plot(maplist$elevation)
```

Optionally, we could stack our two `SpatRaster` objects together and plot them 
together:

```{r}
rstack <- rast(maplist)
plot(rstack)
```

Let's create a boxplot of elevation per land class.

```{r}
#| warning: false
boxplot(rstack$elevation, rstack$landuse, maxcell=50000)
```

Let's import a vector map, too, and explore its attributes.

```{r}
#| warning: false
census <- read_VECT("census")
head(census)
```

```{r}
summary(census$TOTAL_POP)
```

```{r}
plot(census, "P25_TO_34", type="interval", breaks=5, plg=list(x="topright"))
```

Let's do some interactive visualization with `mapview`.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(mapview)
mapview(rstack$elevation) + census
```

We highly recommend you to check the [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) 
package to make really appealing and publication ready maps.

To exemplify the use of `write_*` functions, let's do a simple operation with 
the *landuse* raster map. We will apply a custom function that makes NULL all 
values less than 4.

```{r}
result <- app(rstack$landuse, fun=function(x){ x[x < 4] <- NA; return(x)} )
plot(result)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
write_RAST(result, "result_from_R", overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r}
execGRASS("g.list", parameters = list(type="raster", pattern="result*"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
unlink_.gislock()
```


Finally, there's yet another way in which you can use GRASS and R together, and it 
involves calling R from the GRASS terminal. In this way, *rgrass* will read all 
GRASS GIS session environmental variables, and you won't need to use 
initGRASS. It goes more or less like this:

1. Open GRASS GIS
2. Type `R` or `rstudio &` in the GRASS GIS terminal
3. Load `rgrass` library with `library(rgrass)`
4. Use `read_VECT()`, `read_RAST()` to read data from GRASS into R
5. Do your analysis or plotting in R
6. Write data (back) to GRASS database with `write_VECT()` and `write_RAST()`
7. Quit R `quit()` and get back to GRASS GIS terminal.
